	Have you ever wanted to improve, but not sure how? Are you confused about some tactics and what to do? Either a professinal or a newbie, <br>
	this guide is just for you.
	<h2 class = "titleText">Chapter 1 - PvP</h2>
	<p class = "normalText">PvP stands for player versus player, and it's one of the most important skills in Taming.io of all time. Either in a 1v1, or maybe more, <br>
	knowing the correct techniques is ideal. This chapter will be split into different sections, each explaining tactics for a certain weapon.
	<h3 class = "titleText">Section 1 - Prepearing and Tactics</h3>
	<p class = "normalText">
	Most idealy, you would want to have keybinds. Keybinds are very important for PvP, and help you make actions quicker. Even if you have used the standard 1 - 9 number <br>
	number keybinds for a long time, I would still recommend using keybinds. 1-9 number keybinds are fine, but not the most ideal and hard to preform some actions. I personally <br>
	recommend:
	<ul class = "normalList">Movement: WASD</ul>
	<ul class = "normalList">Food: 2</ul>
	<ul class = "normalList">Boostpad: E</ul>
	<ul class = "normalList">Spikes: F</ul>
	<ul class = "normalList">Primary Weapon: Space</ul>
	<ul class = "normalList">Secondary Weapon: Shift</ul>
	<p class = "normalText">
	With these keybinds, tactics are more simple. Some practices that you should try is spam healing while moving around, try quickly placing boost pads (defencive and offensive),<br>
	and one which is a bit more complicated than what I have shown so far, predicting a arrow's trajectory. This may seem a bit hard at first, but once you see the arrow being fired, <br>
	try juking back and avoid the arrow. Once you have mastered these techniques, the PvP guide should be easier to follow along.
